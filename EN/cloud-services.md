# Cloud services
## Sustainability Considerations
Moving to cloud can generate sustainability savings but there are caveats:
- Generally cloud services run at better efficiency rates than on-premise data centres. This can mean that for your workload, less IT equipment could be required and therefore less energy will be required to run the workload.
- However, it is important to consider the energy mix for the grid in your area when estimating the emissions savings from these efficiencies. 
Large savings can be generated if the energy mix in your area is high carbon.
But, if the energy mix in your area is already all or mostly renewable, the emissions savings from Cloud efficiencies could be negligible.
- In order to determine if moving to the Cloud will generate sustainability savings, you need to measure or estimate the current energy use, waste and emissions for that workload in your on-premise data centre. 
- GHG emissions from purchased cloud services are indirect and are reported under scope 3. It is important to ensure that your organization is reporting on scope 3 emissions so as to not be  
- Cloud companies using renewable energy they are generating themselves
- waste heat reuse
- water use

Many of the major Cloud companies provide emissions information to customers:
- Google provides their Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions
- Microsoft provides their scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions
- Amazon Web Services provides their Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Scope 3 will be available to customers in early 2024.


## Policy measures/Practices

### Set procurement standards for Cloud services regarding sustainability
- Some measures to consider:
  - Cloud provider has set greenhouse-gas reduction targets
  - Cloud provider operate on zero-emission data centre facilities

  
### Require your Cloud services providers to report annually on your emissions from their services

## What Digital Nations are doing
### Canada
Canada commissioned a set of [Green Procurement Criteria for cloud services](https://www.ecpar.org/sites/ecpar.org/files/documents/gpp_criteria_cloud_services_def_en_2022_1.pdf) that was vetted by the buying group Buyers for Climate Action.
