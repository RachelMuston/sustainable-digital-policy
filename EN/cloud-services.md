## Sustainability Considerations
moving to cloud can generate sustainability savings but there are caveats:
- generally cloud services run at better efficiency rates than on-premise data centres and so this can mean that: less IT equipment could be required and also less energy will be required to run the equipment.
However, it is important to consider the energy mix for the grid in your area when estimating the emissions savings from these efficiencies. 
Large savings can be generated here if the energy mix in your area is high carbon.
But, if the energy mix in your area is already all or mostly renewable, the emissions savings from the reduced energy requirements will be negligible.
- emissions from cloud services are indirect and are reported under scope 3. If you are not reporting scope 3 emissions, moving 
- Cloud companies using renewable energy they are generating themselves
- waste heat reuse
- water use

## Policy measures

### Set procurement standards for Cloud services regarding sustainability
- Some measures to consider include:
  - Cloud provider has set greenhouse-gas reduction targets
  - Cloud provider operate on zero-emission data centre facilities

  
### Require your Cloud services providers to report annually on your emissions from their services
