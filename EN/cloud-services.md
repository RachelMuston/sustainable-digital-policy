# Cloud services
## Sustainability Considerations
Moving to cloud can generate sustainability savings but there are caveats:
- generally cloud services run at better efficiency rates than on-premise data centres. This can mean that less IT equipment could be required and also less energy will be required to run the equipment.
However, it is important to consider the energy mix for the grid in your area when estimating the emissions savings from these efficiencies. 
Large savings can be generated here if the energy mix in your area is high carbon.
But, if the energy mix in your area is already all or mostly renewable, the emissions savings from the reduced energy requirements will be negligible.
- in order to know if moving to Cloud services will generate sustainability savings, you need to know the current energy use, waste and emissions for that workload. 
- emissions from purchased cloud services are indirect and are reported under scope 3. If you are not reporting scope 3 emissions, moving 
- Cloud companies using renewable energy they are generating themselves
- waste heat reuse
- water use
Many of the major Cloud companies provide emissions information to customers:
- Google provides their Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions
- Microsoft provides their scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions
- Amazon Web Services provides their Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Scope 3 will be available to customers in early 2024.

## Policy measures

### Set procurement standards for Cloud services regarding sustainability
- Some measures to consider include:
  - Cloud provider has set greenhouse-gas reduction targets
  - Cloud provider operate on zero-emission data centre facilities

  
### Require your Cloud services providers to report annually on your emissions from their services
