# Artificial intelligence (AI) models and tools
## Sustainability Considerations
- significant source of greenhouse gas emissions â€“ not only from the compute cycles but from the production and transportation costs involved in the servers that run the AI programs
- the training of certain very large AI models can emit more than 280 tons of CO2 emissions

## Policy measures/Practices

### Procure AI 3rd part tools that meet sustainability standards
- vendor has set greenhouse-gas reduction targets
- vendor's tools operate on zero-emission data centre facilities

  

### Require the completion of an environmental impact assessments for IT projects using AI
- ensure that any decision to develop, procure or use AI is informed by the results of the environmental impact assessment
