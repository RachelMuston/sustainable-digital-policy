# Data
## Sustainability Considerations
- 70-90% of data that organizations collect is dark data - data that will never be used or turned into insights for the organizations.
- CIOs spend x on storage - this is growing each year
- Make data weight visible - Gerry McGovern
-	Probability of data reuse = 5% after 15 days. - source this (Gerry says it)

## In the news
- add content

## Policy measures
- reduce storage waste - only collect data that you need, get rid of data you don't need (implement data lifecycle process similar to IM lifecycle, deduplication)
- store data efficiently - data compression, [cold storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_data), backups, etc.lifecycle of data
- make your data open - the more of your datasets that are open the less data duplication will exist within your organization. Document the processes for how to make data open in your organization (e.g. applying an open license) 
- make data findable so that it can be reused and not duplicated. Keeping in mind that personal data must be only used in they way that was stated in the privacy statement connected to that data collection. Where possible, ensure that privacy statements allow for data re-use
