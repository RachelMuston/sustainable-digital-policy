# Mobile phones
## Sustainability Considerations
- manufacturing ghgs are high
- lifecycles are often short due to planned obsolescence and phone contracts that provide new phones every 2 years
- often non-repairable
- many organizations are using software like MS Teams, Zoom or Google hangouts for conversations rather than phones
- chargers are often not interchangeable and create e-waste

## Policy measures

### Reduce Phone distribution
Is your organization using video conferencing more than using phones? If yes, determine how many phones are currently unused/rarely used. This can be done by (is there an easy way to do this?). As mobile phones create a lot of emissions during their manufacture and create e-waste, a recommended first step in reducing the environmental impact of mobile phones is to stop distributing mobile phones to employees who do not use them. A better step is to consider reducing phone distribution to only those user profiles who require them - e.g. Executives, field workers, etc. and/or distribute mobile phones only on an exception basis.

### Require ecolabels during procurement
Ecolabels are added to products to verify that the product meets certain sustainability standards. They can be added directly by the company (first party) or achieved through certification with a third party.  The ISO standard 'ISO 14024:2018 Environmental Labels and Declarationsâ€”Type 1 Environmental Labelling' is frequently used by governments around the world as a requirement in procurements.

### Legislate Right to repair and Standard chargers

### Consider circular procurement models such as 'manufacturer take back programs' and leasing
