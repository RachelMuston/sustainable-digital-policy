# Mobile phones
## Sustainability Considerations
- GHG emissions from manufacture are high and may surpass the emissions from use of the phone (depending on the grid where the phone is used and how many years the phone is used)
- Mobile phones create a lot of e-waste because
    - their lifecycles are often short due to planned obsolescence and phone contracts that provide new phones every 2 years
    - they are often non-repairable
    - their chargers are often not interchangeable  
- Many organizations have shifted towards using software like MS Teams, Zoom or Google hangouts for conversations and away from phones

## Policy measures

### Buy fewer phones
As mobile phones create a lot of emissions during their manufacture and create e-waste, a recommended first step in reducing the environmental impact is to buy less. 

Look at the usage data for your organization's mobile phone inventory.
What percentage of phones are unused or rarely used? 

Look at how your mobile phones are used and by who. Is your organization using video conferencing more than using phones? Is your organization using phones for something like security authentication that could better (and more securely) be done by a device with a smaller environmental impact (such as a token)? Are there specific roles that require phones such as employees who are on-call?

Look at whether secure access to work email, calendar and Teams via personal devices is possible.

Are your employees using their mobile phones to hotspot? Consider if it would be possible to redirect funds from mobile phones to improved wifi within your organization's buildings. If your organization uses tablet devices, consider whether a SIM card could be added to the tablet to eliminate the need for a phone to hotspot.

When looking at reducing mobile phones, it is recommended to do an assessment of systemic inequalities, as well as assess how diverse groups of women, men, and gender diverse people may experience this policy change? For example, do you need to communicate with Indigenous and remote communities that often don't have consistent internet access? Does having a work mobile device enable cargivers to remain in the workforce by being able to work while doing caregiving duties like collecting children from school.

Employees who don't use or need their phone may not want to voluntarily give up their phone due to concerns that they might need it in the future. Combat this concern by ensuring that the process to get a new phone is quick and easy if an employee's role changes.

Employees

### Require ecolabels during procurement
Ecolabels are added to products to verify that the product meets certain sustainability standards. They can be added directly by the company (first party) or achieved through certification with a third party. Ecolabels acheived through certifaction provide the best assurance. Many third party ecolabels meet the ISO standard 'ISO 14024:2018 Environmental Labels and Declarations—Type 1 Environmental Labelling'. Requiring Type 1 ecolabels is a critieria frequently used by governments around the world in ICT procurements. Some examples of requirements of type 1 ecolabels for mobile phones include:
- battery removablity/replaceabilty
- reduction/elmination of the use of substances with serious consequences (SVHC substances)
- restriction of phthalates, bromine and chlorine
- reduction of energy consumption of battery charging systems
- post-consumer recycled plastic content in the phone
- recycled fibre used for packaging
- sourcing of conflict minerals (3TG)

### Legislate Right to repair and Standard chargers

### Consider circular procurement models such as 'manufacturer take back programs' and leasing



## What are Digital Nations doing?
### Canada
- Currently at least one federal department is monitoring mobile phone use and if a phone is inactive for 3 months, it is recalled (or requires a managers signature for the employee to keep the phone).
- In [Budget 2023](https://www.budget.canada.ca/2023/report-rapport/chap1-en.html#a2) it was announced that the Government of Canada will work to implement a right to repair and will work with international partners and other stakeholders to explore implementing a standard charging port in Canada.

### UK

### Estonia
- leasing equipment (phones?)
