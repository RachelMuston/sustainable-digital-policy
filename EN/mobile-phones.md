# Mobile phones
## Sustainability Considerations
- GHG emissions from manufacture are high and may surpass the emissions from use of the phone (depending on the grid where the phone is used and how many years the phone is used)
- Mobile phones create a lot of e-waste because
    - their lifecycles are often short due to planned obsolescence and phone contracts that provide new phones every 2 years
    - they are often non-repairable
    - their chargers are often not interchangeable  
- Many organizations are using software like MS Teams, Zoom or Google hangouts for conversations rather than phones

## Policy measures

### Reduce Phone distribution
As mobile phones create a lot of emissions during their manufacture and create e-waste, a recommended first step in reducing the environmental impact is to buy less. 

Look at the usage data for your mobile phone inventory.
What percentage of phones are unused or rarely used? 

Look at how your mobile phones are used and why who. Is your organization using video conferencing more than using phones? Is your organization using phones for something like security authentication that could better (and more securely) be done by a device with a smaller environmental impact (such as a token)? 

If yes, determine how many phones are currently unused/rarely used. This can be done by (is there an easy way to do this?).  A better step is to consider reducing phone distribution to only those user profiles who require them - e.g. Executives, field workers, etc. and/or distribute mobile phones only on an exception basis.

### Require ecolabels during procurement
Ecolabels are added to products to verify that the product meets certain sustainability standards. They can be added directly by the company (first party) or achieved through certification with a third party.  The ISO standard 'ISO 14024:2018 Environmental Labels and Declarations—Type 1 Environmental Labelling' is frequently used by governments around the world as a requirement in procurements.

### Legislate Right to repair and Standard chargers

### Consider circular procurement models such as 'manufacturer take back programs' and leasing
