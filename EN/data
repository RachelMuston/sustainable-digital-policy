- 70-90% of data that organizations collect is dark data - data that will never be used or turned into insights for the organizations.
- CIOs spend x on storage - this is growing each year
- Make data weight visible - Gerry McGovern
-	Probability of data reuse = 5% after 15 days. - source this (Gerry says it)

- make data findable so that it can be reused and not duplicated
