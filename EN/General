## Procurement
### Require suppliers to set sustainability targets
#### UK
Requires suppliers bidding for major government contracts to commit to achieving Net Zero by 2050 and publish a ‘Carbon Reduction Plan’ through their [Procurement Policy note 06/21: Taking account of Carbon Reduction Plans in the procurement of major government contracts](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/procurement-policy-note-0621-taking-account-of-carbon-reduction-plans-in-the-procurement-of-major-government-contracts)
#### Canada
On April 1 2023, Canada implemented the [Standard on the Disclosure of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the Setting of Reduction Targets](https://www.tbs-sct.canada.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32743) which ensures that the process for procurements over $25 million, including taxes, induces suppliers to measure and disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and adopt a science-based target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris Agreement as part of participating in the Net-Zero Challenge or in an equivalent initiative or standard.
